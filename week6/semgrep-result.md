   ❯❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2024-34069
 Severity: HIGH
 Affected versions of Werkzeug are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Exploitation
 requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger
 AND requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control,
 and enter the debugger PIN.

   ❯❯❱ requests - CVE-2018-18074
 Severity: HIGH
 requests versions before and including 2.19.1 are vulnerable to Insufficiently Protected
 Credentials. When an HTTP Authorization header is sent to an HTTPS URI, the server can respond with
 a 302 redirect to a plain HTTP server with the same hostname. Requests will then forward the
 Authorization header to the HTTP server, leaking the contents of the header on an unencrypted
 connection.

    ❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2024-49766
 Severity: MODERATE
 Affected versions of Werkzeug are vulnerable to Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted
 Directory ('Path Traversal'). Werkzeug safe_join() does not reject UNC paths such as //server/share
 because os.path.isabs() (ntpath.isabs) does not treat them as absolute on Windows with Python <
 3.11, so untrusted path components can escape the intended base directory and access unintended
 files. send_from_directory() is affected because it joins the client-supplied path via safe_join()
 internally.

  ▶▶┆ Fixed for werkzeug at version: 3.0.6
   9┆ Werkzeug==0.14.1

    ❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2026-27199
 Severity: MODERATE
 Affected versions of werkzeug are vulnerable to Improper Handling of Windows Device Names.
 Werkzeug's safe_join() fails to reject Windows reserved device names (such as NUL, CON, or AUX) when
 they appear after other path segments (e.g. 'example/NUL'). When send_from_directory() or
 safe_join() is used to serve a file whose path is influenced by a request, an attacker can supply a
 path ending in a device name; opening it succeeds but the subsequent read hangs indefinitely,
 causing a denial of service.

  ▶▶┆ Fixed for werkzeug at version: 3.1.6
   9┆ Werkzeug==0.14.1

    ❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2026-21860
 Severity: MODERATE
 Affected versions of Werkzeug are vulnerable to Improper Handling of Windows Device Names.
 Werkzeug's safe_join() fails to reject Windows special device names (e.g. CON, AUX, NUL, COM1, LPT1)
 when they include a file extension, a compound extension such as CON.txt.html, or
 trailing/surrounding whitespace. When a user-controlled path reaches safe_join() directly or via
 send_from_directory(), an attacker can craft such a name to make file operations hang indefinitely,
 causing a denial of service.

  ▶▶┆ Fixed for werkzeug at version: 3.1.5
   9┆ Werkzeug==0.14.1

    ❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2025-66221
 Severity: MODERATE
 Affected versions of werkzeug are vulnerable to Improper Handling of Windows Device Names.
 Werkzeug's safe_join() (and send_from_directory(), which relies on it) does not reject Windows
 special device names such as CON, AUX, NUL, PRN, COM1, or LPT1. When a user-controlled path resolves
 to one of these implicit device files, the file opens successfully but reading it hangs
 indefinitely, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service.

  ▶▶┆ Fixed for werkzeug at version: 3.1.4
   9┆ Werkzeug==0.14.1

   ❯❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2019-14322
 Severity: HIGH
 Affected versions of werkzeug are vulnerable to Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted
 Directory ('Path Traversal'). The SharedDataMiddleware in Werkzeug improperly handles drive letters
 on Windows, potentially allowing an attacker to craft path requests that bypass filesystem access
 controls, leading to unauthorized file access.

  ▶▶┆ Fixed for werkzeug at version: 0.15.5
   9┆ Werkzeug==0.14.1

   ❯❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2023-25577
 Severity: HIGH
 Werkzeug versions before 2.2.3 are vulnerable to denial of service via uncontrolled resource
 consumption due to werkzeug's multipart form data parser not having a limit for number of parts. A
 request made to an endpoint utilizing accesses request.data, request.form, request.files, or
 request.get_data(parse_form_data=False) can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. Upgrade to
 werkzeug version 2.2.3.

  ▶▶┆ Fixed for werkzeug at version: 2.2.3
   9┆ Werkzeug==0.14.1

   ❯❯❱ werkzeug - CVE-2019-14806
 Severity: HIGH
 Affected versions of werkzeug are vulnerable to Insufficient Entropy. Insufficient randomness in
 Werkzeug's interactive debugger PIN when run inside Docker containers sharing the same machine ID.
 An attacker who can reach the debugger interface can predict or brute-force the PIN, bypass its
 protection and execute arbitrary code.

 Untrusted input might be injected into a command executed by the application, which can lead to a
 command injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands, potentially gaining
 complete control of the system. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid executing OS commands with user
 input. If this is unavoidable, validate and sanitize the input, and use safe methods for executing
 the commands. Untrusted input in a command can lead to command injection, allowing attackers to
 execute arbitrary commands and gain control of the system. To prevent this:

 1. Avoid direct command execution: Don't run OS commands with user input directly. 2. Validate and
 sanitize input: Ensure input is safe by removing or escaping dangerous characters. 3. (preferred)
 Use safe methods: Use `subprocess.run` without `shell=True` to safely execute commands, as it
 doesn't call a system shell by default. If `shell=True` is necessary, properly quote and escape all
 input to prevent shell injection. This is a secure by default approach.
